To build the version 0.091 Rust PPA, I had to modify the following files
so that they supported DESTDIR instead of CFG_PREFIX:
 * configure
 * Makefile.in
 * src/comp/back/rpath.rs
 * mk/install.mk

The changes I made seemed like a hack: there's got to be a better way,
but I don't yet know enough about the Rust makefiles to be ready to
permanently resolve this otherwise.

But it works this way, and I've tested the PPA on my laptop (amd64).
